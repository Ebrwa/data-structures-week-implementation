This project contains the implementation of fundamental data structures in C++ as part of Week 1 practice.

It includes all required structures for Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5 tasks, each implemented in its own `.cpp` file and tested using a `main()` function.

## ðŸ”¹ Day 1 - Implemented Structures

### 1. Dynamic Array  
A resizable array that automatically expands when full.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Access: O(1)
  - Insert (end): Amortized O(1), Worst O(n)
  - Delete: O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Used in dynamic containers like `std::vector`.

### 2. Singly Linked List  
A list of nodes where each node points only to the next node.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) insert at head, O(n) for search/delete.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Useful for linear data where frequent insertions/removals occur at the front.

### 3. Stack using Array  
Implements LIFO using a dynamic array.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for push/pop/peek.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Expression evaluation, backtracking.

### 4. Stack using Linked List  
Stack operations using linked nodes instead of array.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for push/pop/peek.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Better when size is unknown or fluctuating.

## ðŸ”¹ Day 2 - Implemented Structures

### 5. Queue using Array  
FIFO implementation using a circular array.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for enqueue/dequeue/peek.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Print queues, scheduling tasks.

### 6. Queue using Linked List  
Queue using dynamic memory allocation with head/tail.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for all operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** When queue size changes dynamically.

### 7. Doubly Linked List  
Each node points to both previous and next node.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) insert/delete at head/tail, O(n) search.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Navigation history (browser/music players).

### 8. Circular Linked List  
The last node connects back to the first.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) insert at front/tail.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Round-robin scheduling, loops.

## ðŸ”¹ Day 3 - Implemented Structures

### 9. Binary Tree  
Basic tree with left and right child nodes.

- **Supports:** Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversal  
- **Includes:** Height calculation
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Insert/Search: O(n)
  - Traversals: O(n)
  - Height: O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Hierarchical data like file systems or expressions.

### 10. Binary Search Tree  
Sorted binary tree for fast search and insertion.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Average Case: O(log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Dynamic sets, database indexing.

## ðŸ”¹ Day 4 - Implemented Structures

### 11. Min Heap  
Priority queue implementation using binary heap.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Get/Remove Min: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Task scheduling, shortest path algorithms.

### 12. Hash Table  
Implements separate chaining for collision handling.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Average Case: O(1)
  - Worst Case: O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Fast key-based access.

### 13. Graph (Adjacency List)  
Undirected graph using adjacency list.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Add Edge: O(1)
  - Traversal: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Use Case:** Networks, dependency resolution.

## ðŸ”¹ Day 5 - Implemented Structures

### 14. Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)  
Two basic traversal methods.

- **BFS:** Queue-based
- **DFS:** Stack-based (recursive)
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)
- **Use Case:** Search, AI, connectivity check.

### 15. Trie (Prefix Tree)  
Specialized tree for prefix operations.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Insert/Search: O(L) where L is length of string
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * L)
- **Use Case:** Auto-completion, spell-checking.

### 16. Disjoint Set (Union Find)  
Tracks and merges disjoint sets.

- **Time Complexity:** O(Î±(n)) using path compression and union by rank
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Use Case:** Kruskalâ€™s MST, network grouping.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run the Tests

1. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022 (or compatible C++ IDE).
2. Go to any `.cpp` file inside `Day1/` to `Day5/`.
3. Right-click inside the `main()` and select **Run Without Debugging**.
4. Output will show the functionality of the selected structure.
